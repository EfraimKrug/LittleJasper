//
// Building an intelligent therapist...
//
// Client types in a sentence
// Therapist screens sentence for a few high-power words:
//    kill, pain, hurt, angry, murder, wack
//
// Therapist parses sentence structure, and stores structure
//
// Therapist then identifies sentence structure elsewhere
//

var wordList = {
  words: {
      level: 2,
      list: ["kill","pain","hurt","angry","murder","wack"]
    }
}
